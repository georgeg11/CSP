    My name is George Gardner and I am a student at Damien High School, and I am currently enrolled in the AP Computer Science Class.
    Go see my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a> to view all of the projects that I have completed this year, or go check out my <a href="aboutmepage.html">About Me</a> page to learn more about me. I'll leave you with
    one of my favorite quotes:

    “Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.”
